## 1. Introduction:
This repository aims to provide Swift solutions for various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer looking to brush up on your DSA skills in Swift, you'll find a range of problem-solving challenges here.

## 2. How to Use:
- Each DSA problem is categorized and placed in its respective directory.
- Inside each problem directory, you'll find a Swift file with a detailed problem statement and a function stub.
- Your task is to implement the required function to solve the problem. Feel free to add helper functions if necessary.
- Test cases are provided in the same file to help you validate your solution.
- Contributions, improvements, and alternative solutions are highly encouraged.

## 3. Folder Structure:
The repository is organized as follows:
- `DataStructures`: Contains Swift implementations of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.
- `Algorithms`: Contains Swift implementations of various algorithmic techniques like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, recursion, and more.
- `ProblemName`: Each specific problem has its own folder with a Swift file containing the problem statement, solution, and test cases.

## 4. Contributing:
